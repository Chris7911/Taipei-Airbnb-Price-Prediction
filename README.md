## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Taipei is the capital of Taiwan. With Taipei 101, surrounding mountains, and full of entertainment facilities, Taipei has the ability to attract more tourists compared to other cities in Taiwan. Plus, because of the period of coronavirus pandemic, people are not allowed to go abroad for traveling. Therefore, the number of tourists in Taipei during holidays reaches an all-time high. So, this project is aimed to help people who want to make their places earn extra money. Before being a host, people may have the following questions below:

1. Is your location suitable to host on Airbnb?
2. What type of property you can earn from it?
3. What other factors may help you make a decision on the price for your place?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

1. [price_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/Chris7911/Taipei-Airbnb-Price-Prediction/blob/master/price_prediction.ipynb) is the only file walking through individual steps to answer the questions above.
2. [listing.csv](https://github.com/Chris7911/Taipei-Airbnb-Price-Prediction/blob/master/listings.csv) is the dataset used for this project.
