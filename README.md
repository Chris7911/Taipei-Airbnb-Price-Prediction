## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, how to make your place help you earn extra money:

1. Is your location suitable to host on Airbnb??
2. What type of property you can earn from it?
3. What other factors may help you make a decision on the price for your place?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.
